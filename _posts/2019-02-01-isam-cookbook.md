Toghether with [Ebrahim Khalilzadeh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebrahim-khalilzadeh), we published the open-source book "Advanced API Protection Using ISAM" and it's lab components.

The book can be downloaded from this Github repository [authsaz/isambook](https://github.com/authsaz/isambook).

The book needs to setup a lab, that all components are also open-sourced here: [Authsaz](https://github.com/authsaz)

Ebrahim has also published a brief post in Medium about it: [ISAM cookbook for Advanced API Protection](https://medium.com/ibm-security-access-manager-recipes/isam-cookebook-for-advanced-api-protection-a780a5af0162)
