Toghether with other [Swash](https://swashapp.io/) core contributors, we published the Swash's white-paper.

Think of it as data ecosystem for the entire web.
Internet users are the real owners of this data, so, any benefit from this data should be shared with thems.

Swash creates an ecosystem to collect this data, and provide it as data products in a transparent way.
In addition, it also offers sIntelligence and sCompute and sApps.

- **sIntelligence**: A web-based dashboard that provides insights from the data.
Customers can generate reports by querying the data or creating digarams. 
For example, they can analize the age group of users visiting a particluar website over time.

- **sCompute**: A pipeline for running computation tasks on the data to generate processed outputs. 
For example, A data scientist can define an ML algorithm to run periodically on the data, without purchasing it, producing a new data product.

- **sApps**: An infrastructure for building data-aware applications for users. 
For example, an ad-service that leverages user data to target ads, and compensates users when they view them.
