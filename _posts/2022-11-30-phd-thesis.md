I finished my Phd. 
Here is a copy of [my thesis](https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docstore/d:irua:14939).

My PhD was part of [Seco-assit project](https://secoassist.github.io/).
I studied leveraging the information from software ecosystems in improving testing.
SmallAmp, a tool that I implemented during my Phd years, is a search-based test amplification that utilize the existing test methods and improve it based on mutation coverage.

The cover image is created by DALL-E.
Similar to the cover image that is generated from a prompt, I'm looking forward to employ the recent advancements in code analysis and test amplification.
Imagine a code assistant that understand the code, and you can ask it generate a unit tests.	
Exciting world is comming!
