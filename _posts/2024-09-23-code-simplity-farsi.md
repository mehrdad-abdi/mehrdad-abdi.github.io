I translated the awsome book of "Code Simplicity: The Fundamentals of Software" by Max Kanat-Alexander to Persian.
The original book is accessible freely here: https://www.codesimplicity.com/book/

The translation is hosted in a Github repository: [code-simplicity-farsi](https://github.com/mehrdad-abdi/code-simplicity-farsi)

I hope everyone enjoy reading the book.
