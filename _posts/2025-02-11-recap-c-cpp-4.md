# Testing C and C++ Projects

Testing in C and C++ is challenging. because of issues like memory leaks, undefined behavior, and concurrency bugs. Common Challenges in C/C++ Testing:

- No built-in unit testing framework. Unlike Python (unittest) or Java (JUnit), C and C++ require third-party frameworks.
- Memory management issues: Dangling pointers, leaks, and buffer overflows.
- Concurrency issues: Race conditions in multithreaded applications.

## Unit Testing in C and C++

Popular Unit Testing Frameworks
- Google Test (GTest) – Most widely used in C++.
- Catch2 – Header-only, easy to integrate.
- CppUnit – Inspired by JUnit.
- CUnit – Simple framework for C projects.

Writing a Unit Test with Google Test:
```c++
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Function to test
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Unit Test
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
    EXPECT_EQ(add(2, 3), 5);
    EXPECT_EQ(add(-1, 1), 0);
}
```
Run:
```
g++ -o tests test.cpp -lgtest -lpthread
./tests
```
## Code Coverage Analysis

Popular Coverage Tools
- gcov (for GCC)
- llvm-cov (for Clang)
- lcov (visualizes reports)

```
gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage myfile.c -o myfile
./myfile
gcov myfile.c
```

## Static Analysis Tools
Static analysis tools help find bugs without even running the program:
- Cppcheck – Finds logic errors.
- Clang Static Analyzer – Detects memory issues.
- SonarQube – Continuous code quality monitoring.

```
cppcheck --enable=all myfile.c
```

## Performance Testing & Profiling

Performance Profiling Tools
- gprof (GNU profiler)
- perf (Linux performance tool)
- Intel VTune (Advanced CPU analysis)

```
gcc -pg myfile.c -o myfile
./myfile
gprof myfile gmon.out
```

# Memory Safety in C and C++

## What is Memory Safety?

Memory safety refers to ensuring that a program accesses memory correctly, without leaks, overflows, or illegal accesses. 
A memory-unsafe program can crash, produce unexpected results, or introduce security vulnerabilities.

Unlike languages like Python, Java, and Rust, which have garbage collection or built-in safety checks, C and C++ require developers to manually manage memory. 
This increases performance but also makes memory-related bugs common.

Always follow best practices: use smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`), initialize memory properly, and always free allocated memory.

## Memory Leak
A memory leak occurs when memory is allocated but never freed, leading to increased memory usage over time. 
Eventually, this can crash the program.

Why is it a problem?
- Wastes system memory.
- Causes applications to slow down.
- Can crash long-running services due to exhaustion of memory.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

void leak_memory() {
    int* ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * 100);  // Memory allocated
    // No free(ptr), so memory is never released!
}

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
        leak_memory();  // Repeatedly leaks memory
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Always free allocated memory.

## Buffer Overflow

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes past the allocated memory boundary. 
This can corrupt memory, cause crashes, or lead to security vulnerabilities (e.g., exploits in C programs).

Why is it a problem?
- Can overwrite adjacent memory, causing corruption.
- Commonly used in hacking exploits (e.g., stack smashing).

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];  // Only 10 bytes allocated
    strcpy(buffer, "This is too long for buffer!");  // Overflow!
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```
Use `strncpy()` or safer functions.

## Null Pointer Dereference

A null pointer dereference occurs when a program tries to access memory at address 0 (NULL), causing a crash.

Why is it a problem?
- Causes segmentation faults (segfaults).
- Can lead to unexpected behavior in production.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int* ptr = NULL;  // Pointer is NULL
    *ptr = 10;  // Crashes the program (Segmentation Fault)
    return 0;
}
```
Always check for NULL before dereferencing.
```c
if (ptr != NULL) {
    *ptr = 10;
}
```

## Use-After-Free (Dangling Pointers)

A dangling pointer happens when memory is freed, but the pointer is still used.

Why is it a problem?
- Leads to undefined behavior (crashes, data corruption).
- Hard to detect without tools.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int* ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    free(ptr);  // Memory freed
    *ptr = 42;  // Using freed memory (Undefined Behavior!)
    return 0;
}
```
Set pointer to `NULL` after freeing.

```c
free(ptr);
ptr = NULL;  // Avoids dangling pointer
```

## Valgrind

Valgrind is a dynamic analysis tool that detects:
- Memory leaks
- Invalid memory accesses (out of bounds, use-after-free)
- Uninitialized memory usage

Installing
```
sudo apt install valgrind
```

Running
```
valgrind --leak-check=full ./my_program
```

Example output showing a memory leak:
```
==1234== LEAK SUMMARY:
==1234== definitely lost: 40 bytes in 1 blocks
==1234== still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
```

## AddressSanitizer (ASan)

AddressSanitizer is a lightweight alternative to Valgrind for detecting:
- Buffer overflows
- Use-after-free errors

Compiling with AddressSanitizer
```
gcc -fsanitize=address -g myfile.c -o myfile
./myfile
```
This will crash if memory errors exist, showing an exact location.


# AFL (American Fuzzy Lop)

## What is Fuzzing?

Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that feeds a program with massive amounts of random, unexpected, or malformed inputs to uncover crashes, memory corruption, and security vulnerabilities.

Why use fuzzing?

- Finds hidden crashes missed by traditional testing.
- Reveals memory issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free, null dereferences).
- Automated and continuous, requiring minimal manual effort.
- Essential for security testing—used by top security teams worldwide!

Fuzzing is used in security testing for software like browsers, parsers, and network applications. Even companies like Google and Microsoft use fuzzing to test their software!

## AFL (American Fuzzy Lop)

AFL, or American Fuzzy Lop, is one of the most popular fuzzers for C and C++ programs. It’s known for its efficiency, ease of use, and ability to find real-world security vulnerabilities.

Key features of AFL:
- Instrumentation-based fuzzing: It modifies the program during compilation to track execution paths.
- Generates intelligent test cases: It doesn’t just randomize inputs—it learns from coverage feedback!
- Finds edge cases efficiently: Uses genetic algorithms to explore code paths.
- Detects memory errors: Works well with tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) and Valgrind.

## Install AFL
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install afl++
afl-fuzz --help
```

## Preparing a C Program for Fuzzing

Vulnerable C Program (vuln.c):
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void process_input(char *input) {
    char buffer[32];  // Fixed-size buffer
    strcpy(buffer, input);  // Potential buffer overflow!
    printf("Processed: %s\n", buffer);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("Usage: %s <input>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }
    process_input(argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```
This program has a buffer overflow because it doesn’t check the input size!

AFL needs to instrument the program to track execution paths. Instead of compiling with gcc, we use AFL’s compiler wrapper `afl-clang-fast`.

```
afl-clang-fast -g -fsanitize=address -o vuln vuln.c
```

- `-g`: Includes debugging symbols.
- `-fsanitize=address`: Enables AddressSanitizer for memory error detection.
- `afl-clang-fast`: Compiles with AFL’s instrumentation.

## Running AFL Fuzzing

Create an Input Directory. AFL needs a small valid input to start mutating.
```
mkdir input
echo "test" > input/sample.txt  # Provide some seed input
```

Run AFL Fuzzing
```
afl-fuzz -i input -o output -- ./vuln @@
```

- `-i input`: Input directory (seed test cases).
- `-o output`: Output directory (stores crashes & findings).
- `-- ./vuln @@`: Runs our compiled program with the fuzzed input.

AFL is now mutating inputs and testing different paths in the program. The goal is to make it crash!

## Detecting Crashes & Debugging

If AFL finds a crash, a new test case appears in `output/crashes/`.
Check for Crashes
```
ls output/crashes/
```

Reproduce the Crash
```
./vuln $(cat output/crashes/id:000000,sig:SIGSEGV,src:000000,op:havoc,rep:2)
```

## Debugging the Crash with GDB

Using GDB to analyze the crash. GDB shows where the crash happened!

```
gdb ./vuln
run $(cat output/crashes/id:000000,sig:SIGSEGV,src:000000,op:havoc,rep:2)
```

## Hardening Code Against Fuzzing Attacks

After finding a bug, we must fix it and harden our code.

Best practices:

- Use safer string functions: Replace strcpy() with strncpy() or strlcpy().
- Check input sizes before copying: Prevent buffer overflows.
- Enable compiler security flags:
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -fsanitize=address,undefined -o secure secure.c
```
- Re-run AFL after fixing bugs!
